# awesome dmap links

The dmap address: 0x90949c9937A11BA943C7A72C3FA073a37E3FdD96

## core stuff

- [original dmap build/deploy repo](https://github.com/dapphub/dmap)
- [note the dmap.txt file](https://github.com/dapphub/dmap/blob/master/dmap.txt)
- [dpath definition](https://github.com/dapphub/dpath)
- [evilroot / rootcanal](https://github.com/kbrav/rootcanal) -- the "exploit" of the root registry, a kind of lesson about contract architecture

## tools and utilities

- [dmap.sh](https://dmap.sh) -- tiny web UI, resolved over DNS (don't depend on this)
- [the locktopus](https://github.com/dapphub/locktopus) -- local sqlite cache of locked values in the dmap
- [lockpack](https://github.com/dapphub/lockpack) -- draft spec for tiny lockfile format
- [dpack](https://github.com/dapphub/dpack) -- simple address/ABI lockfile spec that plays well with dmap

## namezones

- [root](0x022ea9ba506e38ef6093b6ab53e48bbd60f86832) -- "root" is simply a convention for dpath, dmap does not treat it as special in any way
- [free](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf151b2c51f0885684a502d9e901846d9ffce3d4a#code) -- free as in free-for-all
- [packzone](https://github.com/packzone/packzone) -- append-only 2-level namezone for publishing packages
- [hdmap](https://github.com/rugpullindex/hdmap) -- zone with Harberger tax pricing
